This week I observed Respect among my team members. Respect is the key to success for any team project. If team members don't show respect for each other and don't care about what they are doing, XP will not be of any value to the project. In my team, every team member showed a respectful attitude towards me and towards each other. Everyone paid attention to what all project ideas others proposed, listened to each others suggestions and they showed enthusiasm towards the project goal. Attending your team meeting and reaching the place in time is also advocates respect towards each other.Every team member showed this value in the first week. First day we planned a meeting in Room 664 Library around 3 o'clock in the evening. Everyone reached the meeting location way ahead of time. In the whole week, we had 3 meetings and what I observed is that everyone had respect for other team members' time. Being on time im every meeting, lead to timely decision making till the end of the meetings.
Our team is a mix of people from diverse backgrounds. Initially I was concerned that it would be difficult for all of us to work together respectfully on a single platform. But from the very first meet, me and my team mates never had any such difficulty with each other. We all respect each others cultures and accept each other the way we are. This respectfull attitude will lead to a successfull outcome through the end of our project.
