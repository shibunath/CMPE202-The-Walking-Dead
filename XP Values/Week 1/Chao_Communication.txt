XP value of the team – Communication

At the beginning of a team work, all the team members always need a few conversations to

have a good idea of where each other’s understanding of the project is. A good thing is the

project is about making a game that implements patterns, and by sharing the experience and

opinions on modern or retro games, my teammates all provided potential ideas of what game

we should make. However, the difficulty is we lack the knowledge of relating game features and

design patterns, especially without having decided what game we would make in the project.

We then started to understand the project from the beginning, to pay more attention to the

project requirements. Almost everyone is helping everyone realize details in the project

requirements and submission checklists. And we finally realized the two goals of this project: to

use the design patterns properly, and to create interesting and fun features in the game that

implement those design patterns.

Another issue we encountered is, we wanted to narrow down the game engines we could use

and choose the best one for this project. There are free game engines with visual design

available such as Unity with C#, and Amazon Lumberyard that uses C++ as its background

processing language. However, there is a learning curve for these tools that specifically builds

AAA games, which will complicate the project deeply. Above all, the most important thing is that

it’s even more difficult to apply design patterns in these engines that mostly use visual scripting.

Among the game ideas we had, after having decided to use Greenfoot as our game engine, we

are going to study and apply 5 patterns for the game as for now. They are Observer, Command,

Factory, State, and Decorator.
