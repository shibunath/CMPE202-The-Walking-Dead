A diagram was drawn to explain the background settings of the game to be built. The diagram received a lot of feedback and was easily understood by the team members. This geared up a healthy discussion debating the game design and the ideas behind it. Any innovative changes recommended by the members regarding the game were incorporated to the game design. The ideas of each member were given equal importance and weightage. The team members were encouraged to use the comments section on Github to provide their feedback about the changes made to code. This helps to get the feedback of the coders and helps them to analyze and debate over the changes made. The entire team has an active WhatsApp group and a Google Hangouts group where the team members are encouraged to put their views and feedback regarding the course the project is taking. These conversations go on every now and then. Of course every team member has a different perspective of how things should work. And every feedback needs to be heard and taken account of. No feedback is dismissed by any team member which is a healthy way to be a team player.
