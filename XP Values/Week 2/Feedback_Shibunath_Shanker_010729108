Feedback - Shibunath Shanker- 010729108
The background image of the game design was changed. The team members had different feedback about the change. The feedback from each team member was recorded and analyzed. Our Google hangout group has been very active in collecting and sharing feedback about different commits made by each of the team members in the past week. One of the team members gave an interesting suggestion of a moving background image such that the game appears to be in motion. The team is currently working on implementing this feedback. We had a team meeting on Wednesday to share views about the progress of the game development and decisions were made that have introduced new responsibilities to our team. The team members who couldn’t attend the meeting gave their suggestions and queries through the Hangouts group or the WhatsApp group. Each person’s feedback was given equal importance and weightage. One other suggestion given by a team member was to add sound effects and background music to the game that gave the player a very thrilling ambience. The images were also selected keeping this in mind. Another suggestion was to give the game a very futuristic look and feel. The team is currently working on getting suggestions and feedback incorporated into the game. Considering every person’s feedback is vital to the project’s progress and our team is trying its best to achieve this.
