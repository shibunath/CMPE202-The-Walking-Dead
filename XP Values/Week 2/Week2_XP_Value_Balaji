The XP core value I would be advocating is "Courage". Since we are using agile/scrum based development, each line of code will encounter frequent changes in multiple cycles. Some of the code files are shared between more than one team members. Lack of proper documentation may lead to conflicts either during integration and testing. This was the problem we encountered during our development cycle. The developers who add/modified the code did not add the detailed comments that explained the piece of code. Due to this, other team members did not had any visibility of the changes that happened in the code file which he shared with other team members. These led to confusion and lack of transparency with in the team and have to follow-up with the developer to understand the actual functionality implemented by his code change. Also, this caused redundant code to be present in more than one file that inhibited code re-usability. To address this problem, we made code documentation as a strict discipline with in the team. Any code that lacks documentation has to be addressed immediately or it will be removed from the integration branch. As a team we decided to have proper comments for both GIT Check-ins and as well as method level documentation.  Any violations will have to be promptly notified to the developer and has to be resolved before making further changes to the code. This helped us in improving the code readability and promotes code re-usability.
