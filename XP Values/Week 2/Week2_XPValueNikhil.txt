Respect has always been my team's most valued XP core value. We all respect each other more than just a team member. Whenever we meet for a meeting we always greet each other with a hand shake and a warm hug. In every meeting we talk not only about our project or academics but we also share each other's day-to-day problems. We all have troubles here as we all are living far away from our homes. So, sharing things among each other feels good. We all respect each other's emotions and sentiments.
This week we had 2 meetings. We met in library both times. I went a few minutes late, so everyone was waiting for me. They didn't discuss anything before I arrived so that I don't miss any part of the discussion. I felt respected because of this gesture from my team. As a sign of respect, I apologized for coming late and making them wait for me. Then we started the discussion and meeting ended very well.
One day I was working on a piece of code and was getting some errors in compiling. I was not able to comprehend what to do. Then I posted my doubts on our hangouts group, where everyone replied to my doubts with valueable comments and resources that really helped me move ahead with my code. That was a really kind and respectful gesture from every team member of mine.
Second meeting was short one. We all reached on time so things went really fast and well and we winded up the work really quick.
