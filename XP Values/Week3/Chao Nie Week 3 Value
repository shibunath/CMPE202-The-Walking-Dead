In the third weekly meeting, as we have decided what feature each team member has to

implement, everyone is constantly committing codes on github. However, as expected,

everyone also encountered several obstacles on the way.

First of all, there is a minor problem regarding the following up with github. Whenever someone

pushed new code into the project, the “Greenfoot.project” file comes with any Greenfoot

project gets changed, too. After each one of us tried their way to go around this, we’ve found

the solution and were able to proceed.

The major problem for each team member is to apply design patterns into their features in the

game. With the team lacking experience of game developing of any kind, the only breakpoint for

this problem is to further understand what the patterns are most suit for. On top of this, there

seemed to be another major problem for some of the team members. When their own classes’

objects have to communicate with other people’s classes, the team wasn’t discussing the design

of each one’s class API very well. However, the team uses Google hangouts for any instant

discussion. Every member responds in time, provides explanations and future plans to the

project, specifically regarding the code changes. So the whole progress gets to go on.
