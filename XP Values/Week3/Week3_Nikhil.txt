So we are in the third week of our project development. Every developer is working hard on getting the functionality done that has been assigned to them. Its pretty hard to manage big projects, specially when you have other subjects also. My team members are really hard working and thats why I respect them. They all work really hard on incorporating new ideas into the project. I feel very respectful and proud sitting around them.
This week I observed respect among my team members. Our meeting started of very well. All reached there in time which showed everyone's respect for each others time. This is a high time for all of as we are working on projects of each and every subject, so nobody wishes to waste their time waiting for others. So with that thing in their minds all showed up for the meeting in time and the meeting ended on a good note, all were smiling.
As we are using Github for mainting our code into a single place, so whenever someone pushes any code on github, they notify everyone of us through whatsapp or hangouts before commiting any code, so that everyone gets to know to pull the changes. This shows that we all respect each other by communicating well amongst us.
