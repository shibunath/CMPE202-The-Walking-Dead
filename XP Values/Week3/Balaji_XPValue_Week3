We have reached the third week of development and each of the developer is focusing on core functionality of the application. This week I would like to elaborate how XP values communication, respect and courage played part in our development. To avoid overlaps and conflicts during the initial cycle, we have divided the overall functionality in to independent use cases. Tasks were created from these use cases and similar tasks were grouped as much as possible and assigned to the same developer. This allowed the developer to focus on the end to end implementation of the assigned functionality. Even though some of the use cases were cross cutting and frequent interactions were necessary between the developers. We communicated mostly by messaging tools such as hangouts or by meeting as a group in the library.
These interactions were focused on understanding the integration points between the use cases owned by different developers and brainstorm the overall functionality. We also discuss about the conflicts that occurred during the last 2 weeks of development in terms of code integration and maintainability. We also discussed about avoiding strong coupling between the individual components of the application to reduce the complexity of code integration and confusions that arise due to code overlap. Based on our discussion, we agreed to create abstractions or wrappers for the classes that require frequent interactions or code changes done by multiple developers.
