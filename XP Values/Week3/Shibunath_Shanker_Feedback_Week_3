Feedback - Shibunath Shanker- 010729108
Development for the project is in full swing. Commits are being made by each member of the team to the code on Github. Since each member of the team is looking after a specific module of the project, each member is making commits to their respective modules and any software project involves modules interacting with each other. A module can have classes interacting with other classes. This involves modifying the code written by another team member. This gave rise to interaction among the programmers and they had to give feedback to the coder who had done modifications to the code written by them. To avoid conflicts and chaos, the programmer making the changes in another programmer’s block added suitable comments on Github for the changes he is making. He also needs to provide suitable solutions that would avoid breaking the existing project. Such modifications shouldn’t tamper the existing system. We hold team meetings every week in the library where we book a room to hold discussions and debates over the project features and we are very active on Google Hangouts and WhatsApp to discuss the progress of the project and each team member gives their feedback regarding the status and the progress of the project. If at all an issue occurs, the solutions to the issue are discussed by each team member and and every team member’s feedback is recorded and paid attention to. Each team member is making tremendous contributions to the project and feedback provided by each member is communicated through various means as listed earlier.
