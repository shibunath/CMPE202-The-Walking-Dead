Chao Nie XP value - Communication

As every team member has begun to implement their choice of design pattern, the game project

is being improved constantly. The commitment on github for our project happens quite a lot

more times than before. Many features have been added and we are still talking about changes

and potential features to make the game unique and fun to play.

We had another weekly meeting in the library. As we already got over the conflicts when people

work on different files but also change the files someone is working on, the team work is getting

more and more efficient. Even though we still have multiple features to implement on the

game, the progress seems working better.

Each member is working on different major features for the game, such as background, main

character, and enemy (zombies). After a while, we sort of have an idea of what each other is

working on currently, and what/who caused the problem. During the meeting, the discussion

and progress goes a lot faster than talking through online messaging app. Once someone had an

idea, we can just make the change and have a visual feeling of the game. Another example is,

one teammate of mine is working on the menu and background music. And I also helped to find

sound effects and background image, etc. Test different possibilities of using the sound effects

like with different volume.
