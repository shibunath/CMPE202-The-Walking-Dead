Feedback – Balaji Rengarajulu- 009739275

Having reached the fourth week of development, we as a team had completed the base outline of our game. During this week we finalized the main theme of our game including the background, menu options and actors. By adhering to agile development standards, we discussed about the progress made till date and the impediments each one faced. This outlined the core agile principles “Respect” and “Communication”.
As each member of our team made a significant progress in their own modules, our focus this week was integration. We held discussions within our team to identify the common areas of integration. We identified the problem areas during the integration and steps required to resolve these issues. The outcome of these discussions was communicated to the entire team to collect the feedback from each. Some of the take outs of these meetings were to implement design patterns and best practices to reduce coupling between the modules and increase flexibility of the individual member to modify the code. As part of this exercise, we discussed about the encapsulation and abstraction best practices. 
We also had a demonstration of our game we had developed till date within our team. Then, we brain stormed on the ideas to improve the overall functionality of the game. From this meeting we were able to build a list of new features we would like to implement in our project. This list was then refined based on the feasibility and consent with in our team. The outcome of this was translated to waffle.io tasks assigned to individual team members.
