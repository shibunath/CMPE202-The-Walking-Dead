Feedback - Shibunath Shanker- 010729108
The project is almost nearing completion. Everyone has almost completed the responsibilities assigned to them. Each team member had feedback to give to the other team members. No member was hesitant to share their feedback about the progress of the project which is a good sign which opens up healthy discussions and debates. We have very good discussions in our Google Hangouts group and each member exchanges or shares his opinion or view about either a feature or a programming method used in the game. Our WhatsApp group is also filled with discussions related to the project and its features. Each member has a different view which brings a different perspective to the game. Each discussion ends on a positive note and the team reaches an agreement on every aspect of the game. As usual, we met on Wednesday (April 27th, 2016) this week, to discuss and share our feedback and views related to the game. We were thrilled as we have completed the major features of the game and have reached agreement on most of the issues in the game. Each member also communicated their individual views and opinions about the work done by other team members and every member was flexible enough to quickly adapt to the changes suggested by the member raising concerns about the game and also in implementing those changes. Thus, the feedback of every team member was given equal importance and incorporated into the game.
