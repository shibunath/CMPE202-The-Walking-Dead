So, this was the final week of our project development. We have almost completed all the features of the game, just some tweaks are left to be done. All the members of team have worked very hard in completing the whole task. This week also I have observed the XP core value of respect among my team members. I respect my team members' hardwork and dedication over this project. We all have worked days and nights to put the game into running mode.
This week's team meeting went very well. Everyone was finished with their part of the project and we had a meetup to integrate some of the things. All were very respectful during the whole meeting. There were no signs of anger or hatred or any such negative feeling around in the room. All had some problems with their codes, so we were helping each other get those bugs fixed. This was a very respectful gesture from all the members.
We also went togather to the Computer History Museum this week. After coming back we had a small meeting in library and discussed about the project presentation plans, but Balaji had to go back to his office. So taking care of that point we had a very short meeting. That was a very respectful gesture towards Balaji from all the other teammates. We winded up that meeting quickly and planned on meeting before the lecture next day.
